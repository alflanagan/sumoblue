# Internal And External Libraries

This directory is intended for the project specific (private) libraries.
PlatformIO will compile them to static libraries and link the library to the executable file.

The source code of each library should be placed in a separate directory, like
"lib/private\_lib/[here are source files]".

PlatformIO will find your libraries automatically, configure preprocessor's
include paths and build them.
